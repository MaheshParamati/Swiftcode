Here it generates first n fibonacci numbers based on the conditions
"Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
"Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
"FizzBuzz" when F(n) is divisible by 15.
"BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
the value F(n) otherwise.

For example if I give input as 10 it results in:
Enter the number
10  -->this is the count
??Here it produces 10 fibonacci numbers bases on the above condition??
0 
1 
1 
2 
Buzz -->since the number is divisible by 3
Fizz -->since the number is divisible by 5
8 
BuzzFizz -->since the number is a prime number i.e 13 here 
Buzz -->since the number is divisible by 3
34
